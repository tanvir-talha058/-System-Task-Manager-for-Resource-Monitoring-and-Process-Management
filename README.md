# System Task Manager for Resource Monitoring and Process Management

This project aims to develop a comprehensive, cross-platform task manager tool that integrates
essential features of Windows Task Manager, Linux Task Manager, and macOS Activity Monitor.
Written in Bash, the tool will provide an intuitive command-line interface (CLI) for monitoring
system resources, managing processes, and interacting with open applications. The system task
manager will offer functionality for resource tracking, process control, and application
management, targeting users who need a lightweight yet functional task manager accessible
through the command line.
